        Lorem ipsun Paragraphs & Topic Sentences A paragraph is a series of
        sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a
        single topic. Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a
        few sentences should be organized into paragraphs. This is because
        paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and
        end, and thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and
        grasp its main points. Paragraphs can contain many different kinds of
        information. A paragraph could contain a series of brief examples or a
        single long illustration of a general point. It might describe a place,
        character, or process; narrate a series of events; compare or contrast
        two or more things; classify items into categories; or describe causes
        and effects. Regardless of the kind of information they contain, all
        paragraphs share certain characteristics. One of the most important of
        these is a topic sentence. TOPIC SENTENCES A well-organized paragraph
        supports or develops a single controlling idea, which is expressed in a
        sentence called the topic sentence. A topic sentence has several
        important functions: it substantiates or supports an essays thesis
        statement; it unifies the content of a paragraph and directs the order
        of the sentences; and it advises the reader of the subject to be
        discussed and how the paragraph will discuss it. Readers generally look
        to the first few sentences in a paragraph to determine the subject and
        perspective of the paragraph. That’s why it’s often best to put the
        topic sentence at the very beginning of the paragraph. In some cases,
        however, it’s more effective to place another sentence before the topic
        sentence—for example, a sentence linking the current paragraph to the
        previous one, or one providing background information. Although most
        paragraphs should have a topic sentence, there are a few situations when
        a paragraph might not need a topic sentence. For example, you might be
        able to omit a topic sentence in a paragraph that narrates a series of
        events, if a paragraph continues developing an idea that you introduced
        (with a topic sentence) in the previous paragraph, or if all the
        sentences and details in a paragraph clearly refer—perhaps indirectly—to
        a main point. The vast majority of your paragraphs, however, should have

        of information they contain, all paragraphs share certain
        characteristics. One of the most important of these is a topic sentence.
        TOPIC SENTENCES A well-organized paragraph supports or develops a single
        controlling idea, which is expressed in a sentence called the topic
        sentence. A topic sentence has several important functions: it
        substantiates or supports an essays thesis statement; it unifies the
        content of a paragraph and directs the order of the sentences; and it
        advises the reader of the subject to be discussed and how the paragraph
        will discuss it. Readers generally look to the first few sentences in a
        paragraph to determine the subject and perspective of the paragraph.
        That’s why it’s often best to put the topic sentence at the very
        beginning of the paragraph. In some cases, however, it’s more effective
        to place another sentence before the topic sentence—for example, a
        sentence linking the current paragraph to the previous one, or one
        providing background information. Although most paragraphs should have a
        topic sentence, there are a few situations when a paragraph might not
        need a topic sentence. For example, you might be able to omit a topic
        sentence in a paragraph that narrates a series of events, if a paragraph
        continues developing an idea that you introduced (with a topic sentence)
        in the previous paragraph, or if all the sentences and details in a
        paragraph clearly refer—perhaps indirectly—to a main point. The vast
        majority of your paragraphs, however, should have a topic sentence.
        Lorem ipsun Paragraphs & Topic Sentences A paragraph is a series of
        sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a
        single topic. Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a
        few sentences should be organized into paragraphs. This is because
        paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and
        end, and thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and
        grasp its main points. Paragraphs can contain many different kinds of
        information. A paragraph could contain a series of brief examples or a
        single long illustration of a general point. It might describe a place,
        character, or process; narrate a series of events; compare or contrast
        two or more things; classify items into categories; or describe causes
        and effects. Regardless of the kind of information they contain, all
